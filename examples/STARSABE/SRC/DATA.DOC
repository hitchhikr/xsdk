*** Explanation of various data files ***

* timelist.* --- Enemy appearance times

Format ( time model motion sign x sign y )

Meaning time		Time difference between the previous enemy and the next enemy (30 = 1 second)
        model		Shape Number
        motion		Movement Number
        sign x		Flip horizontally (1 - normal, -1 - reverse)
        sign y		Flip vertically (1 - normal, -1 - reverse)



* model.* --- Enemy shape data

Format
	{
		Magnification (%)
		sprite pattern (0 - square, 1 - circle)
		hit point
		score / 100
		
		x coordinate / y coordinate / z coordinate / color
		:
	}

Color	1...metal
        2...blue
        3...yellow
        4...red
        6... blue
        7...orange
        8...akamura
        9...mura
        11...green

The files are numbered 0, 1, 2, ... from the beginning.
Number 24 is the boss shape, and numbers 25 and above are treated as objects (invincible).


* motion.* --- Describes the enemy's movements.

Command Description
	begin
	end
		An enemy movement starts with begin and ends with end.

	pos	( x, y, z )
		pos specifies the translation amount as a difference

	mrot	( x, y, z )
		mrot specifies the pattern orientation by the difference in rotation angle (256 = 360 degrees) around each axis.

	vrot	( x, y )
		vrot specifies the direction of movement by the difference in rotation angle (256 = 360 degrees) around each axis.

	speed	( speed )
		speed specifies the difference in speed

	count	( count )
		Repeats the previous command the number of times specified by count (30 = 1 second)

	shot	( count, kind [ 0 - stick   1 - ring ] )
		Shot fires when count - number (stick - facing direction, ring - aiming at player)

	born	( count, mod_k, mot_k, sign[ H-reverse ], flag(0 - pos, 1 - pos & rot )
		born will spawn the specified enemy when count - number

	loopstart
	loopend
		Enclose the infinite loop part of the movement with loopstart loopend

	Initialization is done with a count of 1.
	If you use an odd number for pos, it will refer to the coordinates relative to the player's ship at that time.
	Speed: 16 corresponds to 1 in the coordinate system.
	The files are numbered 0, 1, 2, ... from the beginning.


*Note
	Since the system was originally not designed to be edited by anyone other than me,
    there are some stages where exception handling is performed within the program.
	If you want to tweak the details, please analyze it, even though it is a messy program.
	Please note that there are not many comments.
