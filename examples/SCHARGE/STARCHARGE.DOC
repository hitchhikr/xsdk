- Introduction

  StarCharge (hereafter referred to as *Charge) is a competitive action game focused on human versus human battles,
  developed for the Kyoto University November Festival in 1994.

  *Charge is a top-down fighting game with the following features:

  - Because it's a top-down view, you can move around to the side of the enemy while they're attacking and attack them.
    Also, the hit detection is easy to understand.
  - You cannot attack until the Charge meter is full, so there are no traps.
  - Since there is no guard, strategies based on waiting cannot be used.
  - In Expert matches, falling means instant death, making for a tense battle.
  - Because the characters are small, the scale and speed can be increased, making it thrilling.
  - The production period was short, about one month, so the program is poor quality.

  As mentioned above, *Charge has a game design that solves many of the problems with current fighting games.
  Highly recommended for people who are tired of stupid fighting games.
  However, playing against the CPU is not fun, so be sure to play against other people.

- Game Description

  Control your ship (Player 1 is red/Player 2 is blue) and attack the enemy.
  When an attack hits an enemy, the enemy's energy decreases, 
  and if the enemy's energy reaches 0, you win the first round.
  Round 2 The first player to win can move on to the next round.

  Since you can join in on the fun with other players, it's a good idea to invite lots of friends to play.

  There are two types of attacks for your aircraft:
  - FrameSword (fired with trigger A) The range is short, but the power is great.
				Available when the charge meter is yellow or green
  - Power Laser (fired with Trigger B) Has a long range but low power.
				Only available when the charge meter is green
