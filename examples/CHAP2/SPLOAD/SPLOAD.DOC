Sprite data area loader/saver spload.x / spsave.x

                    programmed by chika@kmc



First

  spload.x / spsave.x is a program that loads and saves sprite PCG areas and sprite palettes.
  This program solves the complaints such as not being able to save data in def.x
  and the inconvenience of loading/saving in sm.x (although it's not a particularly great program).



How to use

  spload.x [options] filename If the filename extension is omitted, 
  the default extension is .SP for PCG data and .PAL for palette data.
  If you do not use the -p or -c option, do not include a filename extension.



Option

  The command line options are:
    -p      Processes palette data only
    -c      Processes PCG data only
    -l      Load (default)
    -s      Save
    -b(num) When loading/saving PCG, start from the numth area of the PCG area.
    -n(num) Save num items when saving PCG

  Example:

    spload aho          Load aho.SP, aho.PAL.
    spload -c aho       Load aho.PAL into the palette.
    spload -p aho.pat   Load aho.pat into the PCG area
    spload -s aho       Save to aho.SP aho.PAL.



About spsave.x

  spsave.x is simply spload.x with the -s option set as the default.
  If you use spload.x -s foo when saving, it is obvious that you will get disastrous results 
  if you forget the -s, so it is better to use spsave.x or make spsave an alias for spload -s and use it as spsave foo.



Usage example:

For example, if you want to edit foo.SP and foo.PAL using def.x (the sprite editor included with XC).

    spload foo
    def
    spsave foo

This will allow you to load/save sprite data.



About the Source

  If you do nothing, spload.x (default is loaded) will be created, 
  and if you define the SPSAVE macro and compile it,
  spsave.x (default is saved) will be created (see makefile).



No warranty

  This program is written in the hope that it will work properly,
  but there is absolutely no guarantee that it will work properly.
  We cannot accept any responsibility for any damages that may arise from the use or inability to use this program.
  In particular, the -b -n commands are not used often, so they may have bugs, 
  and there are also some questionable features regarding saving when the disk is full.
  If the PCG area is not saved properly, the unfortunate event of the data you worked so hard to create not being saved will occur, 
  so after saving, be sure to check the number of bytes in the file before turning off the power.
