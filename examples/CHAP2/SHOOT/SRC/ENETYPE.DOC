	It flies in like this.

	state = 0: First time going straight
	state = 1: Retreating diagonally backward
	state = 2: Final straight ahead

2. Small fry chasing you

3 Sin-curve enemies

4 Fixed artillery battery

	flg is 0.... upward
	flg is 1.... downward

	Try your best to set it so that it doesn't float.

5. Hatch

	It moves like this, but the initial direction of movement is the initial values of vx and vy.

7. Mobile artillery battery

	flg is 0.... upward
	flg is 1.... downward

	I'll try my best to set this so that it doesn't float.
	It only moves left and right, so you need to place it on a flat surface.

8. Sin Curve Enemy

	The amplitude is larger than 3.
	Shift the phase by 180‹ using flg

9. Mobile artillery battery

	flg is 0.... upward
	flg is 1.... downward

	It's the kind of thing that moves in a way that suits you.
	This will move up and down on its own, so it's fine to set it to float.
