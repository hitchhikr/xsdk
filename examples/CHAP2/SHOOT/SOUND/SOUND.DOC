Side-shooter sounds
This contains zmusic sources of background music and sound effects.

- Tone

	sound.zms	Tone files
	shoot.zpd	ADPCM data file
	shoot.cnf	ADPCM data configuration file

	At first, the tones were all kept together in the sound effects/BGM file,
    and after the sound was completed, they were separated and the tones were combined into a single file.
	This causes some tone numbers to be missing, but this should not be a problem.

	shoot.zpd is not included in this archive, it's in the actual game.
	shoot.cnf is the configuration file for creating shoot.zpd.
	If you have ZmuSiC, you can create shoot.zpd by using the sampling data 
    included with ZmuSiC and converting it with zpcnv.


- Sound effects

	All sound effects were created using FM sound sources.

	sound01.zms Own shot
	sound02.zms Enemy damage
	sound03.zms Ground enemy destruction sound
	sound04.zms Airborne destruction sound
	sound05.zms Hatch explosion sound

	I created the sound effects in a haphazard manner, thinking, "I guess it should be something like this."
    However, I think the sounds of objects being destroyed on the ground are realistic.

- BGM

	start.zms air Combat BGM
	1st.zms   1st Stage BGM
	2nd.zms   2nd Stage BGM
	3nd.zms   3rd Stage BGM
	boss.zms  boss BGM
		      Composed by Masahiro Susukita/Data created by Naoya Kawahara

	For the FM sound source, I used the one I usually use.
	The original song didn't use many sounds, so the final data didn't either.
