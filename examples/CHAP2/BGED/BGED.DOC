bged.x ver 0.10						1994 chika@kmc

bged.x is a very low-function map editor created to create map data for the second chapter of the game (XEXE).
It is not a graphic editor created by someone with the initial B.
This tool was created solely for creating XEXE, so I don't think this program can be used to create other games, 
but I included it in the hope that readers will find it useful as a reference when creating games.

bged.x has the function to arrange BG parts, but does not have the function to edit the parts themselves.
It is assumed that the parts themselves have been edited in advance using an appropriate sprite editor.
Also, before starting bged, you must load the part pattern data to be used for the map into the PCG area inside the x68k.
Load it using spload or similar.

1. Starting from the command line

  Start with bged (file name).
  If the file specified by the file name exists, it will be loaded;
  if it does not exist, a new map will be edited.

2. How to use.

  Once started, you should see a screen like this:

	-----------------------------------
	|        |  |                     |
	|        |  |                     |
	|        |  |                     |
	|        |  |                     |
	|   1    |2 |         3           |
	|        |  |                     |
	|        |  |                     |
	|        |  |                     |
	-----------------------------------

BG parts are lined up in area 1. 
You can select a part by moving the mouse cursor over this area and pressing the right button (parts mode).

  Area 3 shows the map itself that you are editing.
  Press the left button here to place the selected part.
  Also, if you press the right button here, you can select the part at the mouse cursor position (copy mode).
  You can also select and copy many parts at once by dragging with the right button.

  Various buttons are lined up in area 2.
  Left-clicking on each button will allow you to use various (just kidding) functions.

  The explanation of each button is as follows:

	<<	Scrolls the map 16 characters to the left.
	>>	Scrolls the map 16 characters to the right.
	HR	Flip the parts in area 1 horizontally.
	VR	Flip the parts in area 1 vertically.
	/\	Decrement the palette block of parts in the area 1
	\/	Increment the palette block of parts in the area 1

	ST	Saves map data to disk.
	Q	Exit the program.
        If you press this without saving, you'll cry.

	PT	These two buttons don't have much meaning, they are just for parts mode.
	CP	It only functions as an indicator of copy mode.
		There isn't (it's a remnant of the past).

3. No compensation

   Neither I nor KMC will be held responsible for any damages incurred as a result of using this program.

   I won't give up the copyright, but I don't care anymore, so it doesn't matter.
