pic2sp.x (sprite-pattern maker for DesperadO-X)

- Introduction

  pic2sp is a tool that reduces DoGA PIC format picture data created by the DoGA CGA system, 
  reduces the number of colors to 16, and converts it into sprite data in sm.x pat format.
  By using this program,

    - Data such as robots animated with DoGA can be easily used in games.
    - Even people who can't draw properly can create reasonably decent sprite data by modeling simple shapes.
    - You can easily(?) create games like Desperado.

There are various benefits such as:

- How to use

  1. How to start

    pic2sp (pic filename) [pat filename] [palette file]

    The pic filename specifies the filename of the PIC format data generated by the DoGA CGA system.
    The palette file must be in a format similar to .sm.x .PAL.
    The pic and pat filenames should not have an extension or frame number.
    The pic filename must be specified,
    You do not need to specify the pat filename or palette file.

    If you do not specify a pat filename, the pat filename will be tmp.
    If no palette file is specified, the palette data in the sprite SRAM will be used.

  2. Explanation of each function

    When you start it, you should see a screen divided into four parts like this:

    +------------+------------+
    |            |            |
    |   Area 1   |   Area 2   |
    |            |            |
    +------------+------------+
    |            |            |
    |   Area 3   |   Area 4   |
    |            |            |
    +------------+------------+

    Area 1: Area where the original image is displayed
    Area 2: The area where the converted image is displayed
    Area 3: Area with buttons for each function
    Area 4: Area where the palette table is displayed

    The operations in each area are explained below.

    Area 1: The area where the original image is displayed

        Right-click to get the color of the mouse cursor.

    Area 2: The area where the converted image is displayed

        You can't do anything, just see what the picture will look like after conversion.

    Area 3: Area with buttons for each function

        There are several buttons.
        We will explain them in order, starting with the ones shown at the top.

        1. filename
            The filename of the original image is displayed.
            Clicking the left and right arrows will increase or decrease the frame number.

        2. src size
            Specifies the size of the part of the original image to be converted.
            The center of the original image is fixed at (128,128) and cannot be changed.

        3. dst size
            Specifies the size of the sprite data to be converted in 16-dot intervals.

        4. Convert button (->)
            Click to perform the conversion.
            The conversion is performed by reducing the original image
            and reducing the colors to the palette block selected in area 4.
        
        5. Save button (patt.save)
            If you like the converted sprite pattern, press this button to save it.
            The saved data is in a format that can be read by sm.x.

        6. Palette Make Button
            The 16 most frequently used colors in the original image will be used as the colors of the selected palette block.
            I use it when I don't want to bother picking up the palettes myself, but I don't think it's very useful.

        7. Auto button (auto)
            Clicking this will convert and save all images from frame number 1 to the last.
            Use this when it's a hassle to press -> and save every time.
            Very helpful.

        8. Quit button
            Press when you are finished.
        
        
    Area 4: Area where the palette table is displayed

        Right-click to get the color of the mouse cursor.
        You can get the color of the mouse cursor by left-clicking.
        You can also select a palette block by clicking to the left of it.

    
  3. How to end the session

    Press the button marked quit to exit.
    When you finish, you will be asked whether you want to save the palette table you modified with this program.
    If you want to save it, enter y; if not, enter any other character.

- Finally

    I created this program when I was just learning C and left it as it was, so looking at it now, the code looks very messy.
    Please forgive me for that.

    To create this program, I used GCC, HAS, and HLK.
    I would like to thank all the authors.
