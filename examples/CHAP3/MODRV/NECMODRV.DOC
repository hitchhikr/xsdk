How to use necmodrv.sys:

necmodrv.sys [/id=N]
	N : SCSI ID (0..7)

in config.sys:

device = necmodrv.sys

This will search for the MO connected to X680x0.
If an MO-drive is found, the device driver will be incorporated into Human.

device = necmodrv.sys /id=5

will cause the device driver for whatever device has SCSI ID 5 to be incorporated into Human.
