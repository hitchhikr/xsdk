How to use tapedrv.sys

tapedrv.sys [/id=N] [/fn=NAME]
	N    : SCSI ID (0..7)
	NAME : Device name

in config.sys:

device = tapedrv.sys

This will search for the tape drive connected to X680x0.
If a tape-drive is found, the device driver will be built into Human.

device = tapedrv.sys /id=4

will cause the device driver for whatever device has SCSI ID 4 to be built into Human.

The device name is built in to ST0, but you can also specify the device name with the /fn= option.
