Mouse Point Counter

mspc.x
		by Matsuura Hiroaki(hal@kmc.kyoto-u.ac.jp)

When the mouse cursor is displayed,

    -Press the SHIFT key to display the position in dots.
    -Press the CTRL key to display the character position.

  It will be displayed on the mouse cursor.

-Use mspc -s to make it resident, and mspc -r to make it non-resident.

-This is an all-assembler resident program.
  This is a program that only the most advanced users will need, 
  so most users should use it as a skeleton for a resident program.

-Redistribution, modification, and execution of this program are at your own risk.
