- Introduction

	This program instantly changes the key repeat interval, 
    which is not reset even if you change the setting with switch.x until you reset it.

- About the program

	It's a simple program, so I think you can analyze it quickly.
	The reason for waiting for vertical synchronization is to wait
    and for the purpose of lighting up the LED for some strange effect.

- How to use

	kbdmode.x [ n [ m ] ]
	n: Delay time at the start of repeat ( 200 + n * 100 [msec] )
	m: Subsequent repeat interval time ( 30 + m * 5 [msec] )

	n and m are the same numbers you set in switch.x.

- Conclusion

	I'm sure there are already programs like this, but I haven't seen any around me, so I decided to make one.

	This program is free.
	You may redistribute it however you like as long as it is not modified.
