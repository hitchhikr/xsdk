X68000 version of the side-scrolling action game "DesperadO - X"
				Version 0.29d		                   1995 feb.
----------------------------------------------------------------

- Introduction

  This game is a remake of the original game "DesperadO," 
developed for the MZ-2500 by the Kyoto University Microcomputer Club in 1988.
For the remake, the base game system remained the same,
but various improvements were made to make it suitable for the X68000.
I will omit the details, but this distribution includes a slightly improved version
of the one exhibited at Kyoto University's November school festival in 1992.

- How to play the game

When you start the game, the title demo will start.
Press XF1 / XF2 or a button on the pad to start the game. (If you press ESC here...€)

You (the player) control the red ship (Desperado) and defend the planet Bester by defeating enemies that warp out one after another.
You clear a level by defeating a set number of enemies on each level.

However, an antimatter bomb called "The Tub" has been secretly dropped somewhere on Bester.
If this falls on Bester, it will greatly reduce Bester's nuclear shield.
If your nuclear shield reaches 0, the game is over.
It will be fully restored when you clear a level.

On the next level, you'll encounter enemies that cannot be destroyed in one hit.
It may be possible to get a hit under certain conditions.
Well then, good luck with all 9 levels.

The controls for your aircraft during the game are as follows:

8246 on the numeric keypad / D-pad --- Move your ship (Desperado) up, down, left, and right
                XF2 key / A button --- Reverse the direction of your ship
                XF1 key / B button --- Firing bullets

You can also do the following during the game (even in the replay demo):

               ESC --- Pause (press ESC again to resume)
(During pause) TAB --- Frame forward
          CTRL + G --- Return to title screen
         (pause) Q --- Quit and return to command line

Planet Bester's nuclear shield gauge (decreases dramatically when the basin falls)

 SCORE ------- The current score.
               Points are added when you defeat enemy characters or clear stages.
 ENEMY ------- This is the number of enemy characters you must defeat on this level.
               When it reaches 0, the level is cleared.
 DESPERADO --- The remaining number of your own ships.
               The time you are currently playing does not count.

If the nuclear shield reaches 0, the game is over.
It will recover when the surface is cleared.
