Desperado source description
----------------------------

There is a lot of Desperado source code and it is not possible to explain everything,
so I will only explain the files that I think are difficult to understand what they do.
“xAs a result of the multiple modifications, the code is quite unsightly,
but please forgive me for that.

Compilation was performed using GCC version X6_SX07 based on 1.40.
This code uses special features such as // comments and the IRTE() macro,
so please pay attention to the GCC options when recompiling.
