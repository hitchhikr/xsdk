From Yoshida

It's been two years since it was first released, so you may have forgotten about it, but it's Desperado.
With this latest update, we were able to accomplish many things that we left undone in the first version.
Personally I like that piece.

Please send any complaints or compliments to chika@kmc.kyoto-u.ac.jp.

The version I distributed previously had a poor sound, so I had been wanting to change it someday.
We succeeded in creating a cool sound for the player's shots by using a hardware LFO.
The music has also been significantly upgraded and is very cool, so be sure to listen to it in music mode.
I actually wanted to release it a little earlier, but school and other things meant it was delayed.
Sorry.
