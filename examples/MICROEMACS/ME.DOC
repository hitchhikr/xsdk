              MicroEMACS PRO-68K mini3 Release Notes     15-Sep-1989

                Differences from the original MicroEMACS (Ver3.7J)

(1) The default key assignment is similar to that of ED.X.
(2) Line number display function has been added.
(3) Scrolls the screen line by line.
(4) Create a BAK file when saving.
(5) You can use the cursor keys to select the file to load from the file list.
(6) Supports all five X68000 screen modes (768x512, 512x512, 1024x400, 1024x800, 640x400).

		Upgrading from the previous version (MicroEmacs PRO-68K)

(1) It is compiled using the Milk version of gcc with the -O option (optimization), so it is compact and fast.
(2) The display module has been rewritten to improve display speed.
(3) Display flickering has been made less noticeable to some extent (there is still room for improvement).
(4) File name management is now always performed using absolute path names.
(5) CTRL + cursor up/down allows for fast scrolling.
	(This has nothing to do with key bindings.
     It reads the key matrix at the getchar level and soft-repeats it quickly.)
(6) Shell invocation is now easier to use (SHIFT+F10).
    (Please make sure command.x is somewhere in your execution path.)

                Startup

(1) It starts only with MI.X, but if you put MI.RC MI.HLP in the same directory as MI.X,
    you can set your preferred key bindings and refer to help.
(2) If you change MI.X to another name, you must also change .RC .HLP to the same name.
(3) To improve quality, we recommend that you run FON.X in advance. Åi"A> FON  MYFONT.FON"Åj

                Bugs and more

(1) Emacs distinguishes between uppercase and lowercase letters when specifying file names 
    and considers them to be separate files, but the DOS on the X68000 does not distinguish between 
    uppercase and lowercase letters.
    
    This allows you to display the original of the file you are editing in a separate window.
    
    Also, if you use case sensitivity when opening the same file in a different path or drive, 
    you won't be prompted for the buffer name.


(2) If you use a wildcard to specify a file at startup,

    (a) If there are multiple matching files, select a file.
    (b) If there is one matching file, that file is read.
        (It acts as a kind of filename completion function)
    (c) If there is no corresponding file, a new file will be created, 
        but you will not be able to save it (BUG!), so please rename it with <ESC>-T and save it.

(3) If FON.X is running, you can use SHIFT+cursor keys.

     shift+UP   == ROLL DOWN
     shift+DOWN == ROLL  UP
     shift+LEFT == To the beginning of the line
     shift+RIGHT== To the end of the line
   
    However, TV control will also be performed at the same time, so please remove the DIN 8-pin connector.

     You can also use SHIFT+CTRL+UP to navigate back through the standard console output.
     (This can be done even if EMACS is not running.)
   
     UP        == Look back in the CONOUT buffer.
     DOWN      == Look behind the CONOUT buffer.
     CR or ESC == Exit CONOUT and return to the original screen.
                  The CONOUT buffer size is 16KB.

If you run FON.X, CONOUT will run faster, but the downside is that you will no longer be able 
to use ^P to output to the printer.

(4) It does not support two-byte half-width character codes that are not defined in JIS (X68000 specific).

To the creators of MicroEMACS, who released the source code as a PDS so that users could customize it 
as a living example of an excellent screen editor, and to Richard Stallman, the creator of EMACS.
