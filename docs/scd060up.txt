SCD060.X Update History


1997.10.06Å®1997.10.08

- Avoids the inconvenience of not being able to apply a patch to a file with symbols because the original patch data correction
  difference did not have symbols (the result of applying the patch was no change at all).


1997.10.08Å®1997.10.10

- Fixed a bug in the modified part: Fixed a bug where the shell file name was displayed on the screen when using the command !~
  (debug code was forgotten to be deleted).

- Fixed a bug where __PMPrintPage was changed to __PMPrintPage_ (a bug in the development kit?).

- Fixed a bug that prevented SXCALL ~ from being assembled (lowercase support was incomplete).

- Fixed an existing bug: The error in the power of 10 table was large,
  so it was replaced with a table that is closer to the accurate value.


1997.10.10 Å® 1997.10.15

- Speed-up Speed up mesh display.


1997.10.15 Å® 1997.11.12

- Supports SCD.X v3.01. Fixed a bug where FSAVE/FRESTORE, which protects floating-point registers,
  was canceled when an exception occurred.

- Fixed a bug that caused the index register to be incorrectly processed when displaying the memory contents
  of the effective address during disassembly
  (both the index register value acquisition and the scale factor calculation were incorrect).

- When executing additional steps, IOCS ~ is no longer divided into MOVEQ and TRAP.

Change: Double-byte half-width characters and quarter-width characters can now be displayed correctly.
Prevented the font of "[]" from changing.
Speed up mesh display.
Changed the display of access faults slightly.

- Fixed a bug in the modified part. When displaying the stack frame of an access fault on 68060,
  the TM displayed was 1 less when the TM was 5 or more.

- Fixed an existing bug: If a program being debugged uses the user stack provided by SCD.X as the supervisor stack,
  when an exception occurs, the exception stack frame is destroyed by SCD.X itself,
  and the contents of the exception stack frame are not displayed correctly.
  This has been fixed.

- Fixed a bug where the first and second immediate operands of PFLUSH/PFLUSHS and the first immediate operand 
  of PLOADR/PLOADW/PTESTR/PTESTW were displayed incorrectly during disassembly.

- Fixed a bug that caused FDBcc and PDBcc to miscalculate offsets when assembling and disassembling
  (outputting offsets that were 2 too large when assembling, and addresses that were 2 too small when disassembling).


1997.11.12 Å® 1998.01.18

- Fixed incorrect interpretation of the size field in 68040 and 68060 access errors (the 68060 manual was wrong).


1998.01.18 Å® 1998.11.18

- Correction of existing bugs Fixed a bug where the full format base register and index suppression was not processed 
  when displaying the memory contents of the effective address during disassembly.

- Fixed a bug where DFC was displayed as the SFC value in the register list display.

- Fixed a bug in the modified part. Fixed a bug where PCR and BUSCR were displayed when using 68040.

- Fixed a bug where the spaces before and after LK in the access error message were incorrect when using the 68040.

- On the 68030 to 68060, when a program being debugged stopped due to an exception such as a bus error,
  the contents of unrelated memory (specifically, 28 bytes from .A6+D6 onwards) were corrupted.
  This has been fixed.

- Changed: Previously, $0CBC.w was used to distinguish between 68030/68040/68060, but now it is distinguished by a custom routine.
  With this change, it is now possible to start the program even if 040SYSpatch.x or 060turbo.sys is not registered.
  
- Changed "access fault" to "access error".

- When using the 68040, the access error display shows not only the effective address but also the fault address.


v3.01+09(1998.11.18) Å® v3.01+10(1998.11.23)

- If there is a file with the debugger's main file name plus .cnf or .hlp in the same directory
  as the executable file of the additionally launched debugger, that file takes precedence.

- When the executable file name of the launched debugger starts with db, the behavior of the commands "?" and "P?" is swapped.

- Added a display of the condition fulfillment status, such as
  "HI:1 LS:0 CC:1 CS:0 NE:1 EQ:0 VC:1 VS:0 PL:1 MI:0 GE:1LT:0 GT:1 LE:0 HS:1 LO:0" that was present in DB.X (request: Syo).

- .SR and .CCR can now be used to refer to SR and CCR.

- Added the ability to write parameters to XCCR.

- Added the ability to manipulate CCR bit by bit for XX, XN, XZ, XV, and XC.
  For example, "XC1" sets the C flag, and "XC!.C" inverts the C flag.

- The CCR can now be referenced bit by bit using .X, .N, .Z, .V, and .C.
  Because of this addition, it is no longer possible to refer to the single letter symbols X, N, Z, V, and C.

- Fixed existing bugs

- When calling a shell with the ! command, 
  the usage status of the text screen changes before and after the command, but this function also worked in console mode, 
  so starting a shell in console mode caused problems with subsequent operation of the text screen.
  This has been fixed (reported by Tachibana Eririn).

- Fixed a bug where writing XPC.PC+2 would result in an error even though XD0.D0+2 could be written (reported by Tachibana Eririn).


v3.01+10(1998.11.23) Å® v3.01+11(1998.11.25)

- Change +10: "If the executable file name starts with db..." has been abolished, and ? and P? have been completely swapped.

- ?? had been suppressed separately by a dummy command, so I've brought it back.

- ?? Adjusted so that errors do not occur when used alone.

- Fixed a bug in the modified part.

- Fixed a bug where the cache would be turned off when the debugger was closed when starting in console mode with 68030 
  (from +10, reported by Igarashi-san).


v3.01+11(1998.11.25) Å® v3.01+12(1998.11.27)

- The display of the status of change conditions has been changed to the format 
  "HI:1 LS:0 CC(HS):1 CS(LO):0 NE:1 EQ:0 VC:1VS:0 PL:1 MI:0 GE:1 LT:0 GT:1 LE:0".
