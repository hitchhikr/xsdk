The online help contains information on how to use the menus,
various commands, C evaluation expressions and their notes,
information on coprocessors, and startup options.

This help is intended to provide instructions on how to use it, 
and is not intended as instructional guidance
for the source code debugger.

For details, please refer to the "Assembler Manual,"
"Source Code Debugger Manual," "C Compiler User's Manual,"
and "Extended Manual" that come with
the "C Compiler PRO-68K ver2.1 NEW KIT."

                    How to use SCD - Part 1

The top menu bar has the following functions:

     ¢¤ File   Find   Watch  Exec   Show     

      Trace  Step   Option User process name    

You can switch between Japanese mode and English mode by
selecting "Kanji" or "English mode" from the F8 key menu.

 - By adding the /j option when starting the program,
   it will start in Japanese display mode.

                    How to use SCD - Part 2

The following icon on the menu bar is used
to move the source window and view the source.

     ¢¤ File   Find   Watch  Exec   Show     
      ªª

      b
      „¤„Ÿ„Ÿ Rewinds the source screen to a lower address.

                    How to use SCD - Part 3

The part that says File is called a "pull-down menu,"
and in this case it indicates the "File menu."

     ¢¤ File   Find   Watch  Exec   Show     
            ª
            b
            „¤„Ÿ„Ÿ File Menu

This menu can be opened by clicking the mouse button
or by pressing the F1 key.

                    How to use SCD: Part 4

When you open the File menu, you will see the following:

     ¢¤ File   Find   Watch  Exec   Show     

          „  Quit   „«©
          „¤„ª„ª„ª„ª„®

When you open it with the mouse button,
drag it (move it without releasing the button).
If you open it using the F1 key, pressing F1 twice
will invert the function parts sequentially.
In this state, if you release the mouse button,
or if you use the F1 key, press the return key
to select the menu function.

                    How to use SCD: Part 9

Trace, step through program execution.

      Trace  Step   Option User process name    

              b
              „¤„Ÿ„Ÿ Performs trace execution.

Trace execution traces all actions.
However, stepping does not trace inside functions.

By combining and executing these two functions,
you can efficiently advance the program to the desired position.

                    SCD command notation 1

  <exp> <address>

  Address can be an expression that specifies
  an address at the assembler level.

   Available operators
	+	Addition
	-	Subtraction
	*	Multiplication
	/	Division
	%	Remainder
	&	Logical AND
	|	Logical OR
	!	Logical negation
	^	Exclusive OR

                    SCD command notation 2

   Address expressions that can be used

    03c3            (Hexadecimal)
    \123            (Decimal)
    _1100011        (Binary)
    .symbol         (Assembler symbol names)
    .23             (Source line number addressing)
    ..filename.12   (Address by filename and line number)
                     The extension is omitted.
  <size>
   size   :   s(byte) w(word) l(long) Either
              If <size> is omitted, it is considered to be word.

  <range>
   range  :   <start_address> <end_address>
              or
              <start_address> L<length_byte>

                    C language expression notation 1

<Cexp>
It is written in the same format as expressions in C language.
Example:
    123         (Decimal)
    0x6a000     (Hexadecimal)
    i           (Variable i)
    *p          (The memory contents pointed to by pointer p)
   The scope (visibility) of a variable depends
   on the program counter currently being traced.
   In other words, in order of priority,
   - Variables declared within the current block
   - Variables declared within the current function
   - Static variables declared in the current module
   - Globally declared variables
It will be searched in the following order.
If the current program counter does not belong to any function,
or if the frame pointer is not set at the beginning of
a function entry, only global variables can be referenced.

                    C language expression notation 2

Most types and operators that can be expressed in C
are supported, with the exception of the ternary operator (?:)
and complex cast operators, which cannot be used.
If you want to change the value of a variable,
write an assignment expression. (variable name = value)
Even in other cases, if you write an operator that causes
side effects (such as assignment, increment, decrement, or
function call) in an expression, side effects will occur.
  <format>
   format specifies the format for displaying C expressions
   using one of the following characters.
	  	s  :String
		c  :Character
		x  :Hexadecimal
If format is omitted, the value of the expression
is normally displayed in decimal.
Example:    -? argv[0];s
            Displays the value of argv[0] in string format.

                    Coprocessor Control Commands

XFPCP :FPCP on<>off (/f)
XDIS  :Change source window floating point representation (/d)
XFX   :Change register window floating point representation (/d)
XFP   :Floating point register display on<>off (/x)

Floating-point coprocessor instructions are not available unless
the optional 68882 floating-point coprocessor is installed.
No operations are allowed on floating point values.

All that is allowed is to evaluate floating-point expressions
using C expressions and put the results
in registers or assembler.
In addition, string conversion functions such as
the ECVT function have side effects on their own buffers,
and simply evaluating an expression with the ? command
can change the flow of a program.
The display in parentheses is the option setting
at the time of operation.
